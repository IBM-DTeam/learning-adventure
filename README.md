# learning-adventure
A collection of lessons related to technologies the D-Team uses for new and current team members

## Workshops
Open the `workshops` folder to view a past workshop. The current workshop schedule will be posted here when we start to make workshops. When LabX gets far enough we can probably post the schedule on LabX :D

### Schedule
nothing's happening. boring.

### [nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/)
We may implement `nodeschool` type lessons, but they'd have to be on a private npm registry. This way we can deploy them to others as well.

## Lessons
Open the `lessons` folder to view general lessons.

## FAQ

### What are these .gitkeep files??
They are only for folder structure, please do not delete them out of the repository.

### How do I contribute?
First, you need to decide if you are making a lesson, or a workshop.

If you are making a lesson, make sure you have starter code / example code to help make it easier to learn the material.

If you are making a workshop, you will have to do the scheduling yourself, but please put all your starter code in here and preparation instructions as well before the workshop. We don't want to spend the first 15 minutes running `npm install` for everybody. Make sure to email and remind everyone who signed up for the workshop to actually prepare before the workshop.

## Contributing
We will make it easier to contribute by setting up a generator script or something to help you add a new workshop / lesson.

For example, you'd run `./generate lesson <xyz>` or `./generate workshop <abc>` and then it's easier to get started :)
